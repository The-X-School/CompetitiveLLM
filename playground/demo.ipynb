            "The question \"What is the meaning of life?\" is one of the most profound and enduring inquiries in human thought, and its answer varies across perspectives, cultures, and individuals. Here are some key viewpoints to consider:\n",
            "\n",
            "### 1. **Philosophical Perspectives**  \n",
            "   - **Existentialism**: Philosophers like Jean-Paul Sartre and Albert Camus argue that life has no inherent meaning. Instead, individuals are free to create their own purpose through choices, actions, and personal values.  \n",
            "   - **Absurdism**: Camus suggests that the search for meaning in a chaotic universe is inherently absurd, but one can find fulfillment by embracing life's contradictions and living authentically.  \n",
            "   - **Stoicism & Hedonism**: Some philosophies focus on living virtuously (Stoicism) or pursuing pleasure and fulfillment (Hedonism) as the essence of a meaningful life.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### 2. **Religious & Spiritual Views**  \n",
            "   Many faith traditions offer answers rooted in divine purpose:  \n",
            "   - **Abrahamic Religions**: Christianity, Islam, and Judaism often frame lifeâ€™s meaning as serving a higher power, following moral laws, or fulfilling a divine plan.  \n",
            "   - **Eastern Religions**: Buddhism emphasizes ending suffering (dukkha) through enlightenment and detachment, while Hinduism often ties meaning to dharma (duty) and moksha (liberation).  \n",
            "   - **Pantheism/Unitarianism**: Some spiritual paths view life as a part of a greater, unified existence, where meaning arises from connection to the universe or collective consciousness.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### 3. **Scientific Perspectives**  \n",
            "   - **Biological/Naturalistic**: From an evolutionary standpoint, lifeâ€™s purpose might be seen as survival, reproduction, and the continuation of species.  \n",
            "   - **Cosmic Perspective**: Scientists like Carl Sagan or Stephen Hawking sometimes frame meaning as a byproduct of the universeâ€™s processes, emphasizing curiosity, exploration, and understanding of existence.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### 4. **Psychological & Personal Views**  \n",
            "   - **Viktor Franklâ€™s Logotherapy**: He believed meaning is found through love, work, suffering, or creativity, even in the face of adversity.  \n",
            "   - **Self-Determination Theory**: Modern psychology suggests meaning emerges from autonomy, competence, and relatednessâ€”relationships, personal growth, and contributing to something larger than oneself.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### 5. **Cultural & Societal Influences**  \n",
            "   - Collective values, traditions, and societal roles often shape how cultures define purpose. For some, meaning lies in community, family, or service; for others, in personal achievements or artistic expression.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### 6. **Modern & Individualistic Approaches**  \n",
            "   - Many people today see meaning as fluid, evolving with personal goals, passions, or experiences. It might involve seeking happiness, personal fulfillment, or contributing to humanityâ€™s progress.  \n",
            "\n",
            "### Key Takeaway:  \n",
            "The meaning of life is **not a fixed answer** but a **dynamic exploration**. It can be found in relationships, purpose, creativity, or even in questioning itself. For some, itâ€™s a deeply spiritual quest; for others, itâ€™s about making the most of the time they have. Ultimately, the search for meaning is a personal journey, shaped by your values, beliefs, and experiences.  \n",
